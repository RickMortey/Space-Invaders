# Space-Invaders
Space Invaders game created with Unity

It's my implementation of classic game Space Invaders on Unity based on personal educational experience, also with support of various YouTube tutorials.

The first thing you see is Main Menu where you have two options:
1. Start a game
2. Exit

Then you are free to play!

You can either win or lose. The corresponding menu would pop up and offer you either Retry or Exit. 

Feel free to enjoy. Comments are welcome.
